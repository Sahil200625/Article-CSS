                <b>NEW DELHI:</b> Just over half the 2,000-plus flights that IndiGo operates daily flew on time Saturday (October 5) when the airline suffered a massive system outage that led to serpentine queues across airports with boarding cards being issued manually. The Union aviation ministryâ€™s data shows the impact the outage had on IndiGo on-time performance (OTP), which fell to 54% on Saturday from 80.3% a day earlier. IndiGo, in fact, saw the lowest OTP on Saturday.

    <p align="Justify">
        <big>
            The DGCA has sought a report from the airline on the outage. Comments have been sought from the airline on what caused the same and what steps are being taken to prevent a recurrence. Govt data shows almost 4.5 lakh people flew within the country on Saturday, thanks to the festive rush weekend. Many IndiGo passengers took to social media to complain about the problems, and some of them claimed they missed their flights also.
            "Our airport systems are up and running, and our airport services have eased out effectively. However, we kindly ask for your understanding as we work to restore our other applications," IndiGo said in a post on X at 1802 hours on Saturday.
            In another post on X during the day, the airline had said the option to make a booking or web check-in is temporarily unavailable due to the ongoing system outage.
            At 1344 hours, IndiGo said it was experiencing a temporary system slowdown across its network, affecting the website and booking system.

        <p>"Do you have any clue how many people missed their flights? Have any care for others' problems? This looks more like a railway station and not an airport!" the passenger said in a post on X.
        Another passenger complained that web check-in was not happening for around eight hours.
        IndiGo is the country's largest airline, flying almost 3 lakh passengers daily in both domestic and international sectors.
        This July, a worldwide Microsoft outage had led to airport systems in India also going down for 17 hours. While about 300 flights had to be canceled (mostly IndiGo) then, the ones that operated did so with delays due to processes going manual.
